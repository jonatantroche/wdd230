                    Visual hierarchy refers to the arranging of components in ascending or descending order of importance. This is 
                    accomplished using proportion, color, images, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture, and style.
                    A critical purpose of visual hierarchy is to provide a focal point; this indicates to visitors where the most 
                    critical information is located.

                <h2>Alignment</h2>

                    Although alignment is typically overlooked, without this tool a design would lack a sense of direction, unity, 
                    or organization. Alignment simply refers to how elements are placed on a page. Its purpose goes beyond organization, 
                    it is vital for enhancing the overall visual appeal of a design or page layout.
                    Typically, alignment is applied to two specific design elements: typography and images. Graphic designers attempt 
                    to create a balance between the two so that both images and text are visually appealing and have a seamless connection. 
                    Through good use of alignment, a composition will appear neat, clean, and readable to an audience.

                <h2>Contrast</h2>

                <p>
                    People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well. Imagine a composition without 
                    contrast every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull. Contrast is the 
                    tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.
                    Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A design’s organization is dependent upon how contrast is used 
                    to lead a viewer’s eye towards what is most important. For instance, if all the content within a design was the same 
                    size, how would your audience know what information is the most significant? Through contrast designers are able to 
                    highlight certain elements they want to emphasize, creating a focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.
